# Project Overview
The goal is to create a web application that converts text input into animated videos, aimed at educational purposes.

## Technologies to Use
1. **Frontend Development**:
   - **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
   - **JavaScript**: For interactivity and dynamic content.
   - **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for a responsive and modular design.

2. **Backend Development**:
   - **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application.
   - **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js to handle HTTP requests and responses.
   - **Python (optional)**: For more complex processing, such as using libraries for video generation.

3. **Animation Libraries**:
   - **Three.js**: A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.
   - **Anime.js**: A lightweight JavaScript animation library for creating animations.
   - **APIs**: Consider using APIs like OpenAI's DALL-E for generating animations based on text input.

## Steps to Execute
1. **Set Up the Project Structure**:
   - Create a new directory for the project.
   - Initialize a Git repository.
   - Set up a package.json file for managing dependencies.

2. **Develop the Frontend**:
   - Create components for user input (text area) and display (video output).
   - Implement styling using CSS or a CSS framework like Bootstrap.

3. **Develop the Backend**:
   - Set up an Express server to handle requests from the frontend.
   - Create endpoints for processing text input and generating videos.

4. **Integrate Animation Libraries**:
   - Use Three.js or Anime.js to create animations based on the text input.
   - Ensure the animations are rendered correctly in the frontend.

5. **Testing and Deployment**:
   - Test the application for functionality and performance.
   - Deploy the application using a platform like Heroku or Vercel.

## Follow-Up Steps
- Gather user feedback on the initial implementation.
- Make necessary adjustments based on user input.
